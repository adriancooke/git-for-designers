⚠️ Document status: **Draft**

## Staying up-to-date

You will want to keep your fork updated with upstream changes. This helps ensure your proposed changes stay aligned with other changes to the original and reduces the likelihood of conflicts. 

This is also a necessary step once your PR is accepted, so that you can update your fork with your own changes from the original as the source of truth.

## Sync your fork

*Task: Pull upstream changes into your fork.*

1. Visit your forked repo at `/<your-username>/<project-name>`.
2. Ensure you are viewing the **main** branch (below the project title). 
3. Select the **Sync fork** button above and to the right of the files list.
4. Click **Update branch**. 
5. New commits will be pulled to your fork’s main branch.

Done! Your fork is now synced with upstream. You are now ready to [create a new branch](2-edit-and-commit.md) and repeat the process.
